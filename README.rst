Display drivers for Adafruit MicroPython.
=========================================

Port of display drivers from https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-rgb-display
to Adafruit MicroPython for use on Adafruit's SAMD21-based and other MicroPython
boards.

This driver depends on the Adafruit MicroPython BusDevice module being installed on the
board too: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MicroPython_BusDevice

Note that this driver currently won't work on micropython.org firmware, instead
you want the micropython-adafruit-rgb-display driver linked above!
